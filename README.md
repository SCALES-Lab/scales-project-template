# SCALES Lab Project Template

This project structure supports reproducible, collaborative research using R, Python, GitHub, and Quarto.

## Features
- Compatible with both R and Python workflows
- Modular file structure for functions, scripts, and notebooks
- Quarto-first document generation
- Version-controlled and reproducible by design
- Aligned with tidyverse and PEP8 coding standards

## Getting Started
1. Clone the template
2. Install dependencies via `requirements.txt` or `renv`
3. Start writing scripts in `scripts/` and modular functions in `src/`
4. Use Quarto for writing your manuscript or project reports in `docs/`

## Folder Guide
- `data/`: Store all input and output data (do not overwrite raw data!)
- `resources/`: External files, schemas, literature, etc.
- `scripts/`: Task-based analysis or processing scripts
- `src/`: Reusable code libraries
- `outputs/`: Figures, tables, models
- `docs/`: Reports and manuscripts (use Quarto)
